# csrA-distribution

This project aims to look at the distribution of genes involved in the Csr system and acid stress and tolerance. 

Previoiusly we have established a pipeline to visualize co-occurence with a small data set of culturable microbes from the BEI repository of microbiome strains. 



This time we will be looking at multiple groups of isolates including human microbiome isolates and environmental isolates, assuming we can find a good dataset. 



This is something I'd like to include in my project for publication, if you guys are able to do this than you can get your names on the paper which would be big for your MD and/or PhD apps. 



The systems we will be looking at:

-  Csr (CsrA, CsrD, FliW)

- BarA-UvrY

-  EvgAS

- GadBC

- GadA

- GadXWE

The systems I would like to include as well but we may not be able to:

- CpxAR

- FabA

- FabB

- Cfa

- YdeO

- YdeP



What we need to do:

- [ ] Identify what data sets we want to work with

- [ ] Download the datasets and relevant files

- [ ] Re-annotate if needed

- [ ] Collect our reference genes
  
  - [ ] Find in E. coli & depending on gene in lactobacillus & bacillus
  
  - [ ] Align and determine similarity 

- [ ] Build BLAST database
  
  - [ ] BLAST away

- [ ] Review results and determine next steps
